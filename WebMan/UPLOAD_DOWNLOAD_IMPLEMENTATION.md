# Upload and Download Implementation for WebMan Browser

## Overview

I've successfully added comprehensive file upload and download functionality to your macOS WebView-based browser. The implementation includes proper file handling, progress tracking, user notifications, and security considerations.

## Features Added

### 🔽 Download Functionality

1. **Automatic Download Detection**
   - Detects downloads based on Content-Type and Content-Disposition headers
   - Supports common file types: applications, images, videos, audio files
   - Intercepts download requests and prompts user for save location

2. **User Experience**
   - Native macOS save dialog with suggested filename
   - Real-time download progress shown in window title
   - Progress tracking with percentage display
   - Success/failure notifications with option to show file in Finder

3. **File Management**
   - Handles duplicate files by overwriting existing ones
   - Proper error handling for file system operations
   - Automatic cleanup of temporary files

### 🔼 Upload Functionality

1. **File Selection Dialog**
   - Native macOS open panel for file selection
   - Supports single and multiple file selection
   - Respects website's file type restrictions (MIME types)
   - Handles directory selection if requested by website

2. **MIME Type Support**
   - Automatically converts web MIME types to macOS UTTypes
   - Filters file selection based on website requirements
   - Supports all standard file types

### 🔐 Security & Permissions

The app already has the necessary entitlements in `WebMan.entitlements`:
- `com.apple.security.files.user-selected.read-write` - for file uploads
- `com.apple.security.files.downloads.read-write` - for downloads
- App Sandbox enabled for security

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`BrowserManager.swift`**
   - Added download progress tracking properties
   - Extended WKNavigationDelegate with download handling
   - Extended WKUIDelegate with file upload support
   - Added URLSessionDownloadDelegate for download progress

2. **`SimpleContentView.swift`**
   - Added download progress UI components
   - Implemented same upload/download functionality for the simple view
   - Added progress bar and status display

3. **`AppDelegate.swift`**
   - Enhanced existing WKUIDelegate and WKNavigationDelegate implementations
   - Added file upload dialog handling
   - Added download detection and management
   - Added URLSessionDownloadDelegate for progress tracking

### Key Methods Added

#### Download Handling
```swift
func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, decidePolicyFor navigationResponse: WKNavigationResponse, decisionHandler: @escaping (WKNavigationResponsePolicy) -> Void)
```

#### Upload Handling
```swift
func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, runOpenPanelWith parameters: WKOpenPanelParameters, initiatedByFrame frame: WKFrameInfo, completionHandler: @escaping ([URL]?) -> Void)
```

#### Progress Tracking
```swift
func urlSession(_ session: URLSession, downloadTask: URLSessionDownloadTask, didWriteData bytesWritten: Int64, totalBytesWritten: Int64, totalBytesExpectedToWrite: Int64)
```

## User Experience

### Download Process
1. User clicks a download link or file
2. Browser detects download and shows save dialog
3. User selects save location
4. Download progress shown in window title
5. Completion notification with option to open in Finder

### Upload Process
1. User clicks file input on webpage
2. Native file picker opens with appropriate filters
3. User selects file(s)
4. Files are uploaded to the website

## Testing

To test the functionality:

### Downloads
- Visit any website with downloadable content
- Click download links for PDFs, images, documents, etc.
- Verify save dialog appears and download progresses

### Uploads
- Visit file upload websites (e.g., cloud storage, forms)
- Click "Choose File" or similar upload buttons
- Verify file picker opens with correct filters
- Test both single and multiple file selections

## Technical Notes

- Uses URLSession for robust download handling
- Properly handles download cancellation and errors
- Implements proper memory management and cleanup
- Follows macOS Human Interface Guidelines for dialogs
- Thread-safe UI updates using DispatchQueue.main
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
- Download queue management for multiple simultaneous downloads
- Download resume capability for interrupted downloads
- Upload progress tracking for large files
- Download history and management
- Custom download location preferences
- Drag-and-drop upload support

## Notes

The implementation is fully functional and ready to use. Both the AppDelegate-based main browser and the SimpleContentView have been updated with the same capabilities, ensuring consistent behavior throughout the application.
